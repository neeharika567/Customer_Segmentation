# Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group.

**Workflow of the project**
---

**Customer data** - I have used the *Mall Customer Segmentation Data* dataset from kaggle which is created specifically for learning customer segmentation concepts, also known as *Market Basket Analysis* .

**Data Pre-processing and Data Analysis** - I take the annual income and spending score column from the dataset and I try to find the initial number of clusters using the *Within Clusters Sum of Squares(WCSS)*. The *WCSS* is a measure of the variability of the observations within each cluster. In general, a cluster that has a small sum of squares is more compact than a cluster that has a large sum of squares.

I later plot a *WCSS vs Number of Clusters* graph to find the optimal number of clusters for my analysis. This graph is also called the **Elbow Point Graph** . That value of k(number of centroids) is chosen from where the graph starts to look like a straight line. The value of k in this project is 5.

**Training** - Finally I train my model and each value will get a label based on their similarities and differences with each other.

*kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, init='k-means++', random_state=0)*

*Y = kmeans.fit_predict(X)*

The above statements load the K-Means model in kmeans variable and fit each value of X in the five different clusters.

**Visualization** - The final visualization of the project is as follows:
